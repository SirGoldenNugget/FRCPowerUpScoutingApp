# FRCPowerUpScoutingApp
### Tutorial
In order to run the application you must have Android Studio (version 3.0.1+) installed. Next, download the repository and open the project within Android Studio and click the run button where you will specify whether you would like to run an emulator or export it to an external Android device.
### Features
The app has the capabilities of organizing team data based on total amounts of cubes along with individual breakups into scale, switch, and vault. It also can track climb capabilities. It has two modes of organization: averages and totals--this defines how the application will organize the team list and what priority comes to each.
### About
The FRC Power Up Scouting App was written and developed by Minh Vu (SirGoldenNugget) using Android Studio and was built off an existing code-base of Saverio, a former team 614 member.
